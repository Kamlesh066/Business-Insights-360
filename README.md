# Business Insights 360 - AtliQ Hardware
# Project Overview:
AltiQ Hardware, a fast-growing global company, specializes in selling computers and accessories through three primary channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors. Despite its rapid growth, the company encountered unexpected losses after opening a new store in America. These challenges were initially identified through surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis.

With competitors leveraging advanced analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognized the pressing need to build robust analytics capabilities to remain competitive in the industry.

To gain an edge and embrace data-driven decision-making, AltiQ Hardware initiated the implementation of Power BI for analytics. The goal of this project was to equip stakeholders with actionable insights across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain functions, enabling informed decision-making at every level.

I contributed to this transformative project by applying skills gained from the Codebasics Power BI Course, ensuring a structured approach to developing impactful dashboards and reports.
